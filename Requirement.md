This programming project brings together the concepts you have studied throughout the course. Complete and submit this project before you write the final exam.

Project Options
Two options for programming projects are described below. Select one of these options for your project. You may complete the project using Python.

TASK: Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees
In this project, you will implement Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm and Prim’s minimum-spanning-tree algorithm. 

Assume adjacency list representations of the input graphs.
Implement the fringe data structure as both a binary heap and a linked list. Compare the two methods.
Show each major iteration of the algorithms using animation. Save these animations as .gif or .png files and zip them into a folder with your project report.
Have a user interface in which you can incrementally add edges to the graph and update the trees accordingly.

Submission Requirements
Once you have coded your project, complete the following tasks:

Prepare a project report, which is a polished version of the project design document that also includes experimental results (e.g., charts of running time versus input size).

Your project report must be in PDF or Microsoft Word format. The total number of pages should not exceed 12 pages, standard letter size (8.5 × 11 inches), single spaced, with 1-inch margins, and the text should be in 12-point Times New Roman font. Other file formats are not acceptable.

All the following information and files must be included in your PDF/Word document:

The software and hardware environment you used to develop the project.
The algorithm design (pseudocode).
Testing data, results, and complexity analysis. Include some screenshots showing the running scenarios and running results.
A user manual (e.g., README files).
Discussions and reflection on the knowledge you gained.
References if applicable.
Source files and the executable file.
Prepare a zip folder that contains your project report and the supporting .gif or .png animation files, if applicable.
